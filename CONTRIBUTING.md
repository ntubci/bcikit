## Writing code and documentation

Coding styles, folder structure, and documentation are inspired by [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). 

Like PyTorch, we use [Google style](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for formatting docstrings. Preferably, the length of a line inside docstrings block must be limited to 80 characters to fit into Jupyter documentation popups. 

For reference, this is a good example, refer to this [code](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/nn/modules/conv.html#Conv1d) for this [docstrings](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv1d.html#torch.nn.Conv1d)
